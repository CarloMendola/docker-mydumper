# docker-mydumper
Make fast, parallel backups of your MySQL data with the community built mydumper. A docker container with ability to connect remotely to your datastore and dump the data out logically like mysqldump but much faster. 

- faster than mysqldump
- pull data from remote sources (e.g. Amazon RDS)
- compress large backups to much smaller size compared with file-based backups
